### About


CODialog is a completely configurable, almost pixel perfect replacement for UIAlertView.

- Single file, just drop CODialog.h/m into your project
- Completely styleable and configurable
- No images, everything is drawn in code
- Matches UIAlertView's style very closely

### Enhancements

Forked version with enhancements such as:
  - switching off autosuggestion for text field input
  - acting on whether the dialog is hidden or showing, 
  - Monitoring input focus switching from one text field to another (provided text input style is used.)
  - Can be compiled on Xcode 4.2 and earlier platform, such as Xcode 3.2.5
    
A few memory leaks fixed as well.
